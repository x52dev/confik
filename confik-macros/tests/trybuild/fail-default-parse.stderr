  |                        the trait `From<i32>` is not implemented for `usize`
  |                        this tail expression is of type `i32`
  |
  = help: the following other types implement trait `From<T>`:
            <usize as From<NonZeroUsize>>
            <usize as From<bool>>
            <usize as From<std::ptr::Alignment>>
            <usize as From<u16>>
            <usize as From<u8>>
  = note: required for `i32` to implement `Into<usize>`
